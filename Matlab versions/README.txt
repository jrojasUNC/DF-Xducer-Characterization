These are .mat files adapted from the .txt calibration files that hydrophone manufactures supply.  They have all been standardized (with interpolation if necessary) to run from .25 MHz to 20 MHz in .05 MHz increments.  This allows an FFT of 2000 points at the sampling frequency of 100MHz to yield the same frequency step size.

The 1st column of data is frequency in MHz, the 3rd column is the voltage to pressure sensitivity.

The text files are for LabVIEW to read in order to display the pressure in the A-mode program
